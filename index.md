I am a Swiss Army Knife writer; a deep-dive investigator, academic and bureaucratic  translator, spot news observer, and feature storyteller.

My work has earned a variety of [awards](awards.html) for reporting on government transparency and accountability, and breaking news. Some of my favorite [stories](writing.html) are the ones I know had a direct impact on someone. I believe if people know about and understand the policies and events affecting their lives and communities, they will make better decisions individually and collectively. 

I [write](resume.html) to empower people to tell their stories in an understandable and productive way.
