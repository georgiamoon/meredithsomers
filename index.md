### Work

I've got a decade of experience as a general assignment and investigative reporter. I've covered local, state and federal governments, environmental affairs, education, and all manner of enterprise stories. You can read some of my [favorite](writing.md) pieces to get an idea of what kind of writer I am. I've also a variety of [awards](http://meredithsomers.com/awards.html) for stories on government accountability, Freedom of Information, and breaking news.
