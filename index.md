I am a Swiss Army Knife writer; deep-dive investigator, academic and bureaucratic  translator, spot news observer, feature storyteller.

All stories need to be told, and some of my favorite [stories](writing.html) are the ones I know had a direct impact on someone.

My work has earned a variety of [awards](awards.html) for reporting on government transparency and accountability, and breaking news. I believe deep down that if people know what is going on, if they understand how policies and events affect people and communities, they will make better decisions individually and collectively. 

I [write](resume.html) to empower people to tell their stories in an understandable and productive way.
