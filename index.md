I am a Swiss Army Knife writer; deep-dive investigator, bureaucratic  translator, spot news observer, feature storyteller.

Writing is the greatest [job](resume.html) in the world, and I'll take every chance I get to take advantage of this line of work. I go on daily adventures to meet new people and explore new places. I get access to areas where no one else is allowed. I pick the brains of academics, question politicians, and shake hands with luminaries. I collect secrets. I'm given a pass when I ask probing questions. I'm a confidant, witness, and a vital organ of a system.

My favorite [stories](writing.html) are the ones I know had a direct impact on someone.

I've also earned a variety of [awards](awards.html) for stories on government transparency and accountability, and breaking news.

I consider myself a member of the "traditional journalist" club. I write to put trust back into the relationship between the media and public, and I want to empower people to tell their stories in an honest and productive way.
