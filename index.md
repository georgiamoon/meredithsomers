I am a news writer for the MIT Sloan School of Management and I cover behavioral science and organizational culture, telling the stories of people and their behaviors within the walls of an organization.

I won a 2011 James S. Keat Freedom of Information Award for my coverage of a county commission's closed door budget decisions, and back-to-back Society of Professional Journalists awards for spot news on the 2012 East Coast earthquake and 2013 Navy Yard mass shooting. 

I unapologietically love headline puns, I think the Oxford comma is unnecessary and my dad still calls me a cub reporter.

Here is my [resume](resume.md) and some [clips](writing.md). You can reach me through[ email](mailto:masomers@gmail.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-somers-1665136/).
